# Detection-Tracing-and-Locating-Cracks-in-Structures
This repository corresponds to the final project of course CS543 - Fall 2024 - UIUC

Abstract:
Cracks occur naturally in all structures and pose difficult and dangerous situations to the integrity of the materials. Some cracks are identified in time to repair them without much effort, but the majority are discovered after they are big enough to impact negatively on safety. We expect our program to identify cracks without the need of a human supervisor making it possible to detect them as they start forming.
